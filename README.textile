h2. About

Prails is an open-source PHP framework that is optimized for fast and efficient web development. It is designed to change the way you write PHP. And it's so easy that it's actually fun!
The is the new official version of Prails. For more information, please visit the project's home page at "Prails.org":http://prails.org/ .

h2. Getting started

The typical XAMP setup (Linux/Mac OS X, Apache, MySQL, PHP) will do just fine, but you can also choose to go along without MySQL or even replace it by a PostgreSQL. In case you chose MySQL or PostgreSQL you'll need to create a new database and credentials for accessing that. 

h3. Installation:

1) download the installer and save it to a web server-accessible folder
2) either call the script through your browser or give it executable rights via @chmod +x prails-*.php@ and run it from the console
3) follow the instructions to complete the setup
 
Installation complete! Congratulations!
