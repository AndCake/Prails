		<h1>Class HookCore</h1><br/><br/>
Hooks can be used to enhance functionality already implemented without the need to change it 
For example: a handler can tell he wants to be notified by a hook sink provider. So as soon as 
the hook sink provider is executed, it will then be called.
<br/><br/>
The definition of a hook sink, where other functionality can hook into, happens through this 
class. For this to work, you need to define a unique hook name so that other functionality
won't accidentally be affected. The hooks that use the hook sink defined, will use that hook name
to bind to the sink. 
<br/><br/>
You can define a hook at nearly every position in your code: be it within a template, within 
handler code or even from within libraries. If you're providing a hook sink from within a template
you can use the <code><a href="Tags.html#hook">hook</a></code> tag for this. In a handler you would provide a hook sink using the 
<code><a href="HookCore.html#notify">notify</a></code> method.
<br/><br/>
There is a number of pre-defined hook sinks that one can attach to. They always provide means in 
certain areas to extend/enhance Prails. Those are detail:
<ul><li class='param'><code>404</code> (<span class='type'>HookName</span>)<span class='divider'> - </span>This hook will be called when a certain page cannot be found. This is true not only in case a content asset page is not found, but also in case an event handler is not found. The first hook handler that returns a string, will be the one used for displaying the 404 page's contents.</li>
<li class='param'><code>global-home</code> (<span class='type'>HookName</span>)<span class='divider'> - </span>Will be called automatically when no event handler is specified in the URL. This usually is the base landing page for a project. The first hook handler that returns a string, will be the one used for displaying the landing page's contents.</li>
<li class='param'><code>builder-init</code> (<span class='type'>HookName</span>)<span class='divider'> - </span>Will be called as soon as the Prails IDE loads up. This is helpful in order to extend the IDE itself - for example for providing a kind of administration interface / backend. The output generated by the notified hook handlers needs to be Javascript code. </li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>
<div class='method-type'>Method</div><a name='notify' class='method-title'>notify</a><div class='method'><span class='name'>notify</span>(<span class='parameters'>$hookName[, $context]</span>) &rarr; <span class='type'>Array</span></div>
<ul><li class='param'><code>$hookName</code> (<span class='type'>String</span>)<span class='divider'> - </span>the hook sink's name to provide</li>
<li class='param'><code>$context</code> (<span class='type'>Array</span>)<span class='divider'> - </span>the context that should be present within the notified hooks.</li>
</ul>

Notifies any hooks that are interested in the given hook sink and optionally passes
the given context on to them. The result will be an array of all the results the 
different attached hooks produced.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>
$arr_results = HookCore::notify('login-success', $arr_user);
foreach ($arr_results as $result) {
    if ($result == "forbidden") {
       jumpTo('static/target-forbidden.html', true);
    }
}
</pre>
