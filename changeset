* speed up of re-deployment while in development (ENV_PRODUCTION uses then the optimized/minified JS version)
* added the feature, that everything loaded via the <a href="..." rel="element-id">...</a> does then again fire the dom:loaded event (causing to initialize everything again)
* added new wysiwyg editor. It can be accessed by simply giving any element a CSS class "wysiwyg". On page load it will be automatically transformed into a wysiwyg

* improved taglib parsing to support nested tag evaluation
* improved DBEntry to support on-demand reverse foreign key resolution (for example: having two tables "post" and "comment", while "comment" has a fk_post_id, then if you have a certain post, you could do: #post.comment_list which would then get you all comments of that post)
