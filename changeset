V1.0.6 (September 12, 2010)

* added support for LESS-style CSS code
* added self-updating mechanisms (Prails now checks for newer versions available and gives the developer a hint and what has changed since; when the developer decides to update, Prails updates itself)
* added export of testcases and translations for packaging (and also it's import)
* added testing facilities (selenium-like web-app testing framework, integration into Prails IDE (new button next to "Package" to launch a testsuite and view the logs, a new area for module option editing that enables you to manage testcases module-wise)
* added Browser detection for use in CSS (HTML element gets the browser's type as CSS class appended); for IEs a second CSS class is appended with the used IE version number (like "msie7")
* changed database table prefix for prails' internal tables so that it does not interfere with tables created by developer
* when saving a new translation, the correct tree path is re-opened after page reload
* fixed a problem with favicon.ico causing unnecessary warnings in the log file
* fixed a bug where some project group names led to crc32 codes that were too big to for normal integers, which led to the phenomenon that a wrong value was stored in the database
* fixed a bug where AJAX links did not correctly detect absolute URLs which led to the phenomenon that in Chrome Browsers these AJAX requests were fired with wrong URLs.
* fixed a small bug for IE6 (alerts appearing for each detected PNG)
* when editing a translation, the page type is now correctly used to choose the kind of editing field
* fixed a bug in lang_data which caused a nasty system failure message if no texts table exists
* fixed a bug for the display of resources (resources used in CSS files - like background images - were previously not correctly deployed)
* BASE tag problem in IE fixed by using absolute URLs for items in head
* fixed a bug in the CMS page creation: when creating a new page, the input area was of an incorrect type (just one single line instead of the big wysiwyg editor)


V1.0.5 (August 15, 2010)

* added form field validation
* some debugging for deploying on PHP version < 5.3
* improved tag lib to support formatters (no custom formatters supported yet)
* added render optimiziation for internet explorer versions < 9 (all old versions of IE will try to mimic the IE9 rendering)
* added automatic browser-feature detection
* all POSTs to the server will now be received in a clean-upped way (no more uncertainty of magic quotes).
* added IDE integration for localization: new navigation section Translations
* updated upload target for wysiwyg fields
* added very basic CMS functionality (can be used by creating texts in a cms top section under Translations
* removed caching of localization data for development environments (ENV_PRODUCTION set to false)


V1.0.4 (July 15, 2010)

* added easier AJAX support for links (using the rel attribute you can now define what HTML element's content should be replaced with the content loaded via the HREF attribute of the link).
* speed up of re-deployment while in development (ENV_PRODUCTION uses then the optimized/minified JS version)
* added the feature, that everything loaded via the <a href="..." rel="element-id">...</a> does then again fire the dom:loaded event (causing to initialize everything again)
* added new wysiwyg editor. It can be accessed by simply giving any element a CSS class "wysiwyg". On page load it will be automatically transformed into a wysiwyg
* modified include tag, to make more sense for including other templates (warning: syntax has changed - to include a template you now simply write <c:include file="<module>/<event>" /> so it looks like: <c:include file="blog/viewPost" />
* improved taglib parsing to support nested tag evaluation
* improved DBEntry to support on-demand reverse foreign key resolution (for example: having two tables "post" and "comment", while "comment" has a fk_post_id, then if you have a certain post, you could do: #post.comment_list which would then get you all comments of that post)
* added new browsing feature for database tables
* made global configuration saveable
* fixed  Bug #1 
* improved compatibility of syntax highlighting with the mobile safari for ipad
* fixed bug with CSS and JS lib filesize retrieval
* improved caching mechanism for runlets
* added url rewriting feature for handlers
* improved user-guiding if no Database can be accessed and on the default Prails home page.
* Improved logging to notify project manager (ERROR_EMAIL) if an error occured and notification (ERROR_NOTIFICATION) is turned on
* some code clean up


V1.0.3 (June 27, 2010)

* Added support for SQLite3 databases (you can now use the DB_TYPE setting in the configuration.php to switch between MySQL and SQLite)
* Added support for importing and exporting whole packages (modules, libraries, tables and tags)
* When scaffolding to a module which has already been in use, it is now purged from the file system to immediately reflect the changes done by the scaffolding
* Added log file link to home builder's home screen
* On the first run, the database is now automatically deployed
* Some code clean up


V1.0.2 (June 17, 2010)

* Introduced scaffolding
* Added further help section to builder's home screen
* When creating a new module, a home event is now generated with it
* Introduced global module editing and viewing functionality
* Added DBEntry to enable extended field access functionality (like automatic resolution of foreign keys on demand)
* Much code clean up
