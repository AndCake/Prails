<h3>Website basics</h3>
<div class="progress"><div class="bar" style="width:0%;"></div></div>

<p>All websites are basically documents that are sent from the web server to the client, normally the user's browser (e.g. Safari, Chrome or Firefox). This is called the "request-response model". The browser requests documents via a specific internet address (<em>URL</em>) and the server responds by sending it to the client.</p>
<p>This Prails installation is currently running on such a web server. There are several different kinds of web pages: <em>static</em> ones, that usually stay the same and are just written once for everyone to see. And then there's <em>dynamic</em> web pages, which contain for example user-related information or interactivity.</p>
<p>We will first discuss how to create a <em>static</em> page.<p>
