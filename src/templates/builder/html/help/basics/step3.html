<p>The content you were seeing on the "Bakery Home" page you just opened is just a simple default text. We're going to change the text in a minute. But before we do that, we will take a closer look into the address bar of your browser in that new tab.</p>
<p>When looking at the URL of the "Bakery Home" tab, you will notice, that a part of the URL is called "Bakery", whereas another part of the URL is called "home". This is no coincidence. In fact the structure of the URL in Prails normally is <code>&lt;module name&gt;/&lt;handler name&gt;</code>.</p>
