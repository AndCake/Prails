<div class="progress"><div class="bar" style="width:36%;"></div></div>

<p>Let's take a deeper look into what our generated event handler does. Therefore, <span class="action" data-check="checkOpened()">double-click the home event handler in the left navigation menu</span>. The event handler's details will appear in the center.</p>
<p>At first this might seem a bit confusing. For now, we will just focus on the second column's content that you can find below <em>Output Code</em>. <span class="action">So click at the <code>+</code> button right of the "Output Code" headline.</span></p>
<p>As you might notice, it contains the text that was shown when we ran the event handler. But in addition to that, there are some colored, slightly cryptic texts as well: the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, for example. This is called a <em>Tag</em>, which marks the beginning and end of a level 1 headline. Thereby the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> marks the beginning and the <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> marks the end of it.</p>
<p>Similar, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag marks the beginning of a paragraph, whereas <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> marks the end of the paragraph. This kind of text is called "HTML", which means <u>H</u>yper<u>t</u>ext <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage.</p>
