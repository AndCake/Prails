<h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
<div class="progress"><div class="bar" style="width:93%;"></div></div>

<p>There are many more things to learn about HTML. We will cover some of these things later as we move to the dynamic pages. If you want to learn more about HTML and what other tags there are, please take a look over at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML" target="_new">the Mozilla Developer Network</a>. They have a really good reference of all the tags and their possible attributes.</p>

<p>For styling Prails uses an extended version of CSS, called LESS, which we used already for all our styling. There are many more things to learn here as well. For more information and details, please look at the official <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_new">LESS documentation</a>.</p>

<p>When you are creating your own pages, it depends on the availability of a good design. If you have one before building the page, you can often just compute such information. If not, you can use <a href="http://getfirebug.com/whatisfirebug" target="_new">Firebug</a> for Firefox or the <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview" target="_new">Developer Console</a> in Safari/Chrome in order to fiddle with the CSS attributes before implementing it.</p>
