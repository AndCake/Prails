<h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
<div class="progress"><div class="bar" style="width:88%;"></div></div>

<p>Some links in our navigation menu have a URL of the style <code>static/[some name].html</code>. These are in fact a special kind of content assets, that are not parts of pages which we have seen before, but instead a fully-fledged page, though with static content.</p>

<p>Every content asset that is within the pages top section is actually available as a standalone page. The part after <code>static/</code> indicates what the identifier of the content asset is. For our <code>static/about.html</code> it's the content asset identifier <code>pages.about</code> that is tried to be read. For <code>static/stores.html</code> the identifier is <code>pages.stores</code>. Since both do not yet exist, the 404 error occurs.</p>
