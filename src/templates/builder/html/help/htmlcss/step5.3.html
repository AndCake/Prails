<h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
<div class="progress"><div class="bar" style="width:84%;"></div></div>

<p>We still have to make use of the decorator. Therefore, <span class="action">go back to the home event handler</span>. <span class="action">Make the output code column smaller again</span>, by pressing the <code>-</code> button right of it. Once the Handler code column is visible again, <span class="action" data-check="checkOut()">change it's last line to <code>&lt;- out param, "Bakery:decorate"</code></span>. This will tell the home event handler when run, that it should use the decorate event handler from the Bakery module for it's decoration.</p>

<p>We will take a deeper look into how the handler code (on the left hand-side  works and many of it's possibilities in the "Server-side Scripting" tutorial.</p>

<div class="actions">
	<a href="templates/builder/html/help/htmlcss/step5.2.html" class="ajax" rel="tutorials">back</a>
	<a href="templates/builder/html/help/htmlcss/step6.html" class="next" rel="tutorials">next</a>
</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
	window.checkOut = function() {
		var code = getCodeForHandler("home", true);
		return code.search(/<-\s*out\s+param,\s*"Bakery:decorate"/) !== -1;
	};
</script>
