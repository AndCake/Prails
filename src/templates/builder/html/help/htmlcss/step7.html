<div class="progress"><div class="bar" style="width:92%;"></div></div>

<p>There are many more things to learn about HTML. We will cover some of these things later. If you want to get more in-depth information on HTML and what other tags there are, please take a look over at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML" target="_new">the Mozilla Developer Network</a>. They have a really good reference of all the tags and their possible attributes.</p>

<p>For styling Prails uses an extended version of CSS, called LESS, which we used already for all our styling. There are many more things to learn here as well. For more information and details, please look at the official <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_new">LESS documentation</a>.</p>
