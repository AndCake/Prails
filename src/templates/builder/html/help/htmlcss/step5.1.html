<h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
<div class="progress"><div class="bar" style="width:76%;"></div></div>

<p>Now we have a nice homepage. But what about the other pages? In order to not copy &amp; paste everything or even create everything anew, Prails has a concept, called <em>decorators</em>. This means, an event handler can "decorate" itself with the result of another event handler. This decoration usually is something like the header, footer and sometimes additional navigation elements. But the actual page's content still is generated by the actual event handler for the page. In order to prepare for creating new pages that all share our header including the navigation menu and the footer, we'll create such a decorator.</p>
