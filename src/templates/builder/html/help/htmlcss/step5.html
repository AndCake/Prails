<h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
<div class="progress"><div class="bar" style="width:72%;"></div></div>

<p>When you try it out, you'll notice, that the different content areas, so the news, the featured area and the introduction are all just below one another. Not particularily nice... Let's change that.</p>

<p><span class="action" data-check="checkDP()">Go to the Bakery module styles and add a new rule for both: <code>#news, #featured { .dp50; } </code></span>. This <code>.dp50;</code> is, as you might have guessed another mixin, which is responsible for making an element taking 50% of the available space and make all following content float right of it. As both are 50%, they take all the available space, but share it in one line.</p>

<p>There are also other flavors of this mixin, for example <code>.dp33;</code>, <code>.dp25;</code> or <code>.dp20;</code> but you can also have it even more flexible than that using the configurable mixin <code>@dp(48%);</code>, whereas you can set the 48% to anything of your liking.</p>
