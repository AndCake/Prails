            The Generator manages the template handling. In general there is one basic template that should be usable for all applications, 
			as it contains only a skeleton which is filled with the actual contents during the page generation process. 
			Every page is decorated with this template, except pages, which are set as AJAX pages (see setIsAjax below).
